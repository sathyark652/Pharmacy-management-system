# Pharmacy Management System using MySQL
Database Management System Project

This project is a comprehensive Pharmacy Management System that effectively tracks records of customer-ordered drugs through prescriptions from the company. The project leverages MySQL as the relational database management system to manage and query data efficiently.

## Project Highlights:
Database Queries: The system is equipped with a wide range of SQL queries to handle various aspects of pharmacy management, including retrieving customer data, managing prescriptions, and more.

Joins: Utilizing SQL joins, the project seamlessly combines data from multiple tables, ensuring comprehensive and accurate information retrieval.

Aggregates: Aggregate functions are employed for statistical analysis and summarization of data, providing valuable insights into drug orders and sales.

Cursors: Cursors are utilized for efficient traversal and manipulation of query results, enhancing the system's data processing capabilities.

Triggers: Trigger mechanisms are implemented to automate certain database actions, enhancing data integrity and reducing manual intervention.

Functions: SQL functions are integrated to perform specific tasks and calculations on the data, offering enhanced functionality and data processing options.

CRUD Operations: The project supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to manage tables and records seamlessly.

## Frontend Connectivity:
The project features a simple frontend developed in Python to demonstrate the integration of MySQL with a user interface. While the frontend is minimal, it showcases the connection between the relational database and the user interface.
